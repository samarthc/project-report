\subsection*{Summary of challenges completed}
\paragraph{}
\subparagraph{\href{http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/}{Bandit}}
The bandit wargame only focuses on \textbf{teaching} command line utilities that might be useful in exploits, not actual exploits
\begin{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Levels 0 - 6: } ssh and basics of command line; \code{ls, cat, file, find} \footnote{Reading up on \code{find} was useful for me, as initially I was using \code{ls} to \code{grep} for non-executables, then stripping out filenames and piping to \code{du} and \code{file}}
    
    \item \textbf{Levels 7 - 12: } matching text with \code{grep}, finding a uniquely string with \code{sort} and \code{uniq}, decoding base64 data with \code{base64}, deciphering a ROT13 cipher with \code{tr}, uncompressing a hexdump with \code{xxd} and \code{tar}
    
    \item \textbf{Levels 13 - 16: } working with network protocols; ssh using a private key, using \code{telnet} and \code{openssl} to exhange data, using \code{nmap} to scan for open ports
    
    \item \textbf{Level 17: } used \code{diff} to compare two files and extract the password
    
    \item \textbf{Level 18: } used \code{scp} to transfer files from an ssh server that logs you out immediately on logging in due to a modified .bashrc, thus bypassing the shell on the remote PC

\subsection*{Work done till now}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Completed till Level 17 NATAS, Level 10 of HTS Basics and all Javsascript challenges on HTS.
	\item Completed till week 2 of the coursera course of Software Security by the  University of Maryland. 
	\item Studied basic of Architecture and 3 address code and a little bit about processors.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Work was done in a discontinous manner without a proper timeline, since more time was spent on learning and developing rather than actual hacking.}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{NATAS Level 0 to Level 2} : Basic HTML source code checking, browser tools etc
	\item \textit{NATAS Level 3 to Level 5} : Basic scripting and request tampering
	\item \textit{NATAS Level 6 to Level 8} : Basic PHP injection and reverse engineering from source code. 
	\item \textit{NATAS Level 9 to 11} : Injecting bash commands from PHP and reverse engineering from known encryptions.
	\item \textit{NATAS Level 12 to 13} :  Injecting files that run system commands into the website to hack data. 
	\item \textit{NATAS Level 14 to 17} : SQL injection using arguments, sometimes requiring python based brute forcing. 
	\item \textit{HTS Basic Level 1 to 10} : Basic PHP, SQL injection and command line injection
	\item \textit{HTS Javascript Level 1 to 7} : All challenges were trivial except the last which required brute forcing from the console. 
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Future work:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Work forward with system architecture and reverse engineering binaries.
	\item Move on to Narnia wargames for hacking
	\item Start blogging about good challenges.
\end{itemize}
